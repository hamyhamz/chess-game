# Chess-game
Two-player chess game implemented in python for further AI experimentation

## Initial idea
 
 The main idea behind this project was to implement a fun project in python. 
 This game concept has been chosen, as it is one of the easier tasks at hand, which 
 are easily verified if they work as intended. 
 
 Another aim of this project was to present basic programming concepts and paradigms 
 to a beginner to be a student. In this case, a game would be a fun and challenging 
 task to take up from start to finish.
 
## Implementation design

 As chess is a two-player game, we will be using a server-client framework implementation
 in python programming language implemented via sockets. Also, OOP design patterns will be 
 used further in the project. 
 
The server part of the implementation will keep information about the board and provide all 
possible moves to the client-side of application. It will be considered as the processing core 
of this implementation. Client-side applications will mostly be handling only the representation 
of the board and pieces themselves. As well as recording the user inputs for the game.

## Further plans

The goal is to implement a simple environment suitable for experimentation with different
AI methods. Also as a playground for implementing AI players who will be able to compete
with their AI or human opponents.
